## [Solutions for Google Code Jam Qualification Round 2019](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051705)

Qualified with 41pts.
I had other things to do so I didn't have time to try the other 2 questions, but you just needed to pass these questions to qualify.

### [Foregone Solution](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051705/0000000000088231)
My solution: Treat it as a string and replace all `4` with `3` to get first number. Then subtract `num - first` to get the `second` number.

### [You Can Go Your Own Way](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051705/00000000000881da)
I used a swap function, you change all the `S` to `1`, then all the `E` to `S`, sthen all the `1` to `S`. You basically get a mirror of the first string.
