## [Solutions for Google Code Jam Qualification Round 2019](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051705)

Qualified with 41pts. I had work so I only had time to do these 2.

### [Foregone Solution](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051705/0000000000088231)
My solution: Treat it as a string and replace all `4` with `3` to get first number. Then subtract `num - first` to get the `second` number. 

<b>Test Set 1</b>  6pts/6pts </br>
<b>Test Set 2</b> 10pts/10pts </br>
<b>Hidden Set</b> 1pts/1pts </br>

I used a swap function, you change all the `S` to `1`, then all the `E` to `S`, sthen all the `1` to `S`. You basically get a mirror of the first string.

`SESESE` would become

`ESESES`

<b>Test Set 1</b>  5pts/5pts </br>
<b>Test Set 2</b> 9pts/9pts </br>
<b>Hidden Set</b> 10pts/10pts </br>
